# Ai Proxy reference docs

## Overview

This is a reference implementation showing how to integrate a TinyMCE application with the TinyMCE [AI Assistant](https://tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/ai/).

It is *not* a production-ready application. It is for demonstration and training purposes only.

## First step

Review the OpenAi Proxy call flows diagram below.

It presents a high level overview of the interactions between the required components that enables the OpenAi suggestions feature.

The documentation following describes, in more detail, how to implement these interactions as a reference towards configuring your own solution.

## Component 1: the main TinyMCE application

The reference application is a NodeJS server which serves a single page *Message of the Day* application. 

The NodeJS server has 6 endpoints:

| endpoint                                            | path                         | purpose                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`GET /`](../example-app/index.js#L50)              | ../example-app/index.js#L50  | Serves the application page.                                                              |
| [`GET /ai-request.js`](../example-app/index.js#L51) | ../example-app/index.js#L51  | Serves the ChatGPT shim.                                                                  |
| [`GET /authenticated`](../example-app/index.js#L54) | ../example-app/index.js#L54  | Returns 200 for a logged in user and 403 for a logged out (unauthenticated) user.         |
| [`GET /jsonwebtoken`](../example-app/index.js#L57) | ../example-app/index.js#L57  | Serves a JSON Web Token containing the authorized capabilties of the authenticated user. This makes use of a secret shared between the example-app and the proxy, stored in the environment variable `EXAMPLE_APP_JWT_SECRET`, to sign the JWT.         |
| [`GET /message`](../example-app/index.js#L77)       | ../example-app/index.js#L77  | Serves the current message of the day.                                                    |
| [`POST /message`](../example-app/index.js#L89)      | ../example-app/index.js#L89  | Updates the current message of the day.                                                   |
| [`POST /login`](../example-app/index.js#L105)        | ../example-app/index.js#L105  | authenticates a username/password and creates a session cookie so the users is logged-in. |
| [`POST /logout`](../example-app/index.js#L122)      | ../example-app/index.js#L122 | Invalidates the session cookie so the user is logged-out.


The application has 2 states: 

1. **Logged out**
  * the *Message of the day* is displayed but cannot be edited.
  * a user can login with the hardcoded credentials `admin`/`admin`  
  **Important**: this is a demonstration only, care must be taken to handle credentials properly in a production application.
  
2. **Logged in**
  * a TinyMCE editor holds the current *Message of the day* and can be used to edit it.
  * While logged-in it is possible to use the AI plugin to query Chat GPT 3.5.

### ChatGPT shim
The [`example-app/ai-request.js`](../example-app/ai-request.js) file defines a
function used as a shim between TinyMCE's AI plugin and the OpenAI API.

The AI plugin is agnostic to the AI provider, allowing you to adapt different AI backends.

To do this, the integrator must adapt to the provider API.

This example uses ChatGPT 3.5.

| [Line 5](../example-app/ai-request.js#L5)          | The generic interface TinyMCE provides. The `request` parameter includes the text of the request in `request.prompt`. The `respondWith` parameter provides adapters to different situations. In this case `respondWith.stream` is used to get access to streaming-related values. |
| [Line 6](../example-app/ai-request.js#L6)          | The `stream` option gives us access to `signal` which is an [AbortSignal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) and `streamMessage` which is a simple callback that takes a string to be added on to the existing content. |

| [Line 21](../example-app/ai-request.js#L21)        | Specifies, using the `content-type` header, that the `body` will contain JSON and includes the JWT to authorize the request with envoy.  <br/>**Note**: the `authorization` header does not include the OpenAI API key. This `authorization` header will be replaced by the envoy proxy to use the OpenAI API key before it is forwarded to OpenAI. This allows it to be hidden from end users. |

| [Lines 52 to 54](../example-app/ai-request.js#L52) | Rethrows any errors to abort processing. |

## Component 2: the proxy server

Envoy is used to proxy the requests after they are filtered by the Open Policy Agent (OPA).

This makes use of these two container images from Docker Hub:

* [envoyproxy/envoy](https://hub.docker.com/r/envoyproxy/envoy)
* [openpolicyagent/opa](https://hub.docker.com/r/openpolicyagent/opa).

These both use configuration files in the `/config/` folder:

* [`envoy.yaml`](../config/envoy.yaml) configures the Envoy proxy
* [`opa.yaml`](../config/opa.yaml) configures the Open Policy Agent.

The Open Policy Agent also makes use of the Rego files to script the process of authenticating and moderating the requests to be sent to OpenAI.

### envoy.yaml

The [`config/envoy.yaml`](../config/envoy.yaml) file is heavily commented but here is an overview.

| lines                                         | purpose                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Lines 1 to 5](../config/envoy.yaml#L1)       | Sets the port where the admin page is hosted. The admin page is useful for debugging problems but it is strongly recommended that it not be made accessible remotely as it makes available serveral destructive operations. |
| [Lines 8 to 16](../config/envoy.yaml#L8)      | Configures the proxy server to listen to connection requests on port 8080. This is repeated for both IPv4 and IPv6 so that it will listen to connection attempts from both. |
| [Lines 28 to 29](../config/envoy.yaml#L28)    | Says that the proxy is not serving as multiple hosts but rather treats all incomming as to a single host.                                                                   |
| [Lines 31 to 36](../config/envoy.yaml#L31)    | Tells the proxy to send everything that passes the filters and that goes to the path /v1/ to the OpenAI cluster (defined later) on behalf of the client.                    |
| [Lines 38 to 51](../config/envoy.yaml#L38)    | Tells the proxy how to add CORS headers though it won't actually do the addition of the headers until the related filter.                                                   |
| [Lines 53 to 63](../config/envoy.yaml#L53)    | Filters out requests to the health check "/ping" and handles it without passing the request onwards.                                                                        |
| [Lines 64 to 73](../config/envoy.yaml#L64)    | Stores the path of the request in a lookup for a later filter.                                                                                                              |
| [Lines 74 to 76](../config/envoy.yaml#L74)    | Adds the CORS headers using the previously defined rules (Lines 37 to 50).                                                                                                  |
| [Lines 77 to 98](../config/envoy.yaml#L77)    | Runs the Open Policy Agent when the path matches /v1/ and filters the requests based on running the rego scripts which are specified in opa.yaml.                           |
| [Lines 99 to 101](../config/envoy.yaml#L99)   | Runs the HTTP router which is required.                                                                                                                                     |
| [Lines 103 to 116](../config/envoy.yaml#L103) | Tells the proxy to define the OpenAI cluster as all IP addresses returned by a DNS lookup on api.openai.com which should be contacted in a round-robin fashion. It also specifies that the list of IP addresses should be regularly queried to ensure changes are reflected. |
| [Lines 118 to 130](../config/envoy.yaml#L118) | Tells the proxy to use TLS when contacting api.openai.com.                                                                                                                  |


### opa.yaml

The [`config/opa.yaml`](../config/opa.yaml) file defines what the open policy agent does.

### authz.rego
The [`config/authz.rego`](../config/authz.rego) file is the entrypoint for checking
the requests. 

| line(s)                                     | purpose                                                                                          |

| [Line 6](../config/authz.rego#L6)           | Functions and variables are imported from `webapp.rego`.                                         |
| [Lines 11 to 13](../config/authz.rego#L11)  | OPTIONS requests are approved so that any CORS preflight requests complete.                      |
| [Lines 16 and 17](../config/authz.rego#L16) | User authorization is checked. See `webapp.rego` for details.                                   |
| [Lines 18 and 19](../config/authz.rego#L18) | The server configuration environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` existence is checked. This ensures a less confusing error message; it is not essential for a production implementation. |
| [Lines 20 to 24](../config/authz.rego#L20)  | Any POST requests going to the completion endpoint are moderated. See `openai.rego` for details. |
| [Line 25](../config/authz.rego#L25)         | All checks passed: the request is forwarded to OpenAI.                                           |

### webapp.rego
The [`config/webapp.rego`](../config/webapp.rego) file contains the logic for checking
if the client is authenticated along with the reply that is sent when authentication fails.

| line(s)                                     | purpose                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Line 6](../config/webapp.rego#L6)   | Reads the environment variable, `EXAMPLE_APP_JWT_SECRET`, into a variable with the default value `"Default JWT secret"`. The same default is used on the example app for ease of configuration. In a production quality application, however, this should always be set from the environment variable. |
| [Lines 9 to 14](../config/webapp.rego#L9)   | Defines the error message sent if request authentication fails. |
| [Lines 17 to 34](../config/webapp.rego#L17) | Checks to see if the request contained a valid JSON Web Token which authorizes the user to use the OpenAI chat completions API. This makes use of a secret shared between the example app and the proxy to check that the JWT is valid. |

### openai.rego

The [`config/openai.rego`](../config/openai.rego) file contains

* the logic for querying the moderation endpoint of OpenAI; and
* the messages that should be sent.

| line(s)                                      | purpose                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### log.rego

The [`config/log.rego`](../config/log.rego) file ensures that sensitive information is not logged.

| line                            | purpose                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Line 4](../config/log.rego#L4) | Stops the `authorization` header being logged from input requests. |
| [Line 5](../config/log.rego#L5) | Stops the `authorization` header being logged in results.          |

## Component 3: the integrator authentication endpoint

The nodejs server provides a [`/jsonwebtoken`](../example-app/index.js#L57) endpoint which can be used to generate a signed JSON Web Token authorizing the request.

This is called by the example-app and then included in the `authorization` header
with the request to the envoy proxy.

The envoy proxy then [validates this JWT](../config/webapp.rego#L25) as part of
the request processing. This ensures the caller is authorized before forwarding
the request to OpenAI.

Alternatively, implement this by passing the session cookie to the proxy and
having the proxy call the `/authenticated` endpoint.

In this example application, the authentication component has been simplified to
illustrate the allow and reject states. For example, a dummy database with
hardcoded credentials is used instead of a real database. As well, the JWT is
signed with a shared secret rather than a public/private certificate pair.

A production configuration must be tailored to the applicationâ€™s production authentication requirements.
